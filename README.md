# Hi, I'm Claudiu Ivan

### Principal Architect & Engineer specializing in high-performance systems for FinTech & InsurTech.

I architect and build the complex data-intensive systems that power FinTech and InsurTech. My practice is built on a decade of experience translating extreme business requirements into resilient, scalable, and provably correct software.

I'm always open to discussing complex technical challenges and new opportunities.
